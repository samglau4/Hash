# Hash
Demonstration of Repeated Hash

This cpp project is to demonstrate how a password (via textfile of strings) is still insecure with just a hash function.

It is to emphasize the importance of salting in password security by revealing a hashed value can provide multiple passwords if they share the same password.

Project is initially ran in Eclipse Luna with console output.
